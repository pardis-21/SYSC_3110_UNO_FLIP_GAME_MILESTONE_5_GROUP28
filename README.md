----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSC 3110 Project Overview Milestone 3 UNO: 
This milestone is continuing on from the previous milestone, but instead, its implementing an AI Player feature and a FLIP Mode. 
The AI player is like a human player, but instead it plays like a human player. It includes the addition to more Game Logic and an AI Player class.
Furtheremore, the addition of the FLIP SIDE was implemented where when a player plays a FLIP CARD, it flips from DARK MODE to LIGHT MODE and vice-versa. 
This game plays as before and match points are determined based on the points attributed to each card. 

The main deliverables include:
Implemening the AIPlayer Feature
Implemteing UNOFLIP Feature
Maintain quality code with minimal smell for maintainability, expandibility and cohesiveness.

SYSC 3110 Project Overview Milestone 2 UNO:
This milestone is about converting milestone 1 into a GUI following MVC pattern.
It includes the main gameplay logic, player management, unoFrame, UnoController and card functionalities.
all supported by unit tests and UML/Sequence diagrams to illustrate the system.

The main deliverables include:
Complete implementation of all classes(Card, Player, PlayerOrder, GameLogicModel, UnoView, UnoFrame, UnoController and Game)
UML and Sequence Diagrams represent the system's structure and interactions between various classes.
Unit tests for all classes and methods in the game.
